        <ul>
          <li>Web Content<p>Any part of the website, i.e. text, images, forms, multimedia, markup code, scripts,
              applications and many more.</p>
          </li>
          <li>User Agents<p>The software used to access the web, including desktop graphical browsers, voice browsers,

        <h2>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines: WCAG</h2>
        https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/
        <h3>Page Title</h3>
        <p>The title element resides within the head, which is read by screen readers, shown in search engine results,
          shown in browser tabs and shown in the window title bar. </p>
        <p>The webpage title is the first thing that a screen reader will access. You must ensure that the title
          effectfully communicates the content of the page and different pages on the website are able to be discerned.
        </p>
        <h3>Image Text Alernatives</h3>
        <p>These are used by users who can't see the image. Alt tags communicate the purpose of an image. If an image is
          just decorative and people don't need to know about the image, then it should have null alt (alt=""). </p>
        <ul>When not to include an alt text
          <li>The alternative text does not need to include the words "button", "link", or "image of". (Screen readers
            automatically provide that information.)</li>
          <li>If the image is not important for understanding the content — for example, it is just decoration or "eye
            candy" — it should have null alt (alt=""). </li>
          <li>If the image is sufficiently described in the text — for example, a simple diagram illustrating what's
            written in the web page text — it can have brief alt text such as "Diagram of work flow as describe above."
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          alt attribute in HTML (not "alt tag")
          
          In HTML (which is web page code, called markup), alt is an attribute of the image element, and other elements. (So "alt tag" is technically incorrect; the correct terminology is "alt attribute", or you can say "alt text".) It looks like this in markup: <img alt="WAI logo" src="/wai/logo.png">

        <h2>How do you test the accessibility of a web project?</h2>
        <p>There are many different ways to use the web besides a mouse and a pair of eyes. Users may navigate with only
          a keyboard or using their voice. For all the different ways to understand and to interact with a website, it
          is necessary that the page structure, design and code is properly set up.</p>
        <p>There are different ways to test the accessibility of the design, code and the content of a website. This
          page details guidelines for uses, as well as, resources on how to test your work.
